# OTC LATAM - Project One-Pager

## Order-to-Cash Platform Modernization Initiative

### Executive Summary
OTC LATAM consolidates and modernizes our Order-to-Cash systems across Latin America, unifying MIOSS (domestic sales) and SIV (export sales) into a single cloud-native platform. This initiative will serve 100+ users, process 5,000+ orders annually, and reduce operational costs by 30% while improving processing speed by 40%.

| • Duplicate data entry and processes | • Modern tech stack (Angular 18, .NET 8) |
| • Outdated technology (.NET Core 2.1, Angular 6) | • Cloud-native on Azure PaaS |
| • High maintenance costs ($4M+ annually) | • Single sign-on for all users |
| • Security vulnerabilities | • Real-time analytics dashboard |
| • Poor user experience | • Mobile-responsive design |
